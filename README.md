# Flask-APP-with_REDIS_on_kubernetes
Deploying a Dockerised Flask app with Redis on Kubernetes, to show inter-communication of pods/containers
These are the Project files for my project which is displayed on my portfolio website @ "https://solutions-architect.co.uk/kubernetes/"
You may use these files to recreate the project yourself.
Installing helm as an application manager on kubernetes is optional  you can use kubectl commands with no problems. Dont forget to retrieve the external ip of the flask app so you can access it, and also check the communication between the two containers.
